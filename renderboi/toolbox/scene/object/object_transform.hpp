/* ╔════════════╗

 * 
 * The aim of the Transform class is to represent the 3D properties of an 
 * object relative to a global frame of reference.
 * The aim of the ObjectTransform class, which inherits from Transform, is to 
 * represent the 3D properties of the SceneObject which it is attached to.
 * However, the representation is in that case relative to the frame of
 * reference of that SceneObject's parent (hereafter "the parent frame of 
 * reference").
 * 
 * For convenience, when applying a transformation to a Transform through one
 * of its methods, it is possible to specify, through a template parameter, 
 * which frame of reference the provided arguments are relative to.
 * 
 * ▫ FrameOfReference::World
 *   Indicates that the provided arguments are relative to the global frame
 *   of reference.
 * 
 * ▫ FrameOfReference::Parent
 *   - In the case of an ObjectTransform, which is attached to a SceneObject,
 *     indicates that the provided arguments are relative to the parent frame
 *     of reference.
 *   - In the case of a pure Transform, which is attached to no SceneObject and
 *     thus has no parent, the provided arguments are interpreted as being 
 *     relative to the global frame of reference, making
 *     FrameOfReference::Parent strictly equivalent to FrameOfReference::World
 *     in that context.
 * 
 * ▫ FrameOfReference::Self
 *   Indicates that the provided arguments are relative to the transform on
 *   which the transformation is about to be applied.
 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * For the ObjectTransform, all of this gives place to some convoluted logic 
 * as to how the base methods are called, in order to do what the overridden 
 * methods should actually do.
 * More details in object_transform.cpp.
